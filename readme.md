## ISSUES(ohno)

- The canvas isnt working aaa
- Phaser with electron is pure pain
- Man i need sbytes for this
- A bit of a skill issue.
- Beginner to annoying JS.
- No translations- only speaks english fluently.

## What its gonna look like

- Menu. Just animated with cringe pixelly stuff.
- A player in a pixelly world
- Surviving night in the world(like an island)
- Making forts and machines
- Monsters getting harder and harder to defeat
- Researching and making new technology(guns, planes, etc.)
- Basically civilization and evolution with survival(like muck)
- Add pixelly textures.(yes, pixelly.)

## Future stuff:

Rapid gamemode(hard, boss comes at night 5+)

- Less items(more like rapid death!)
- Harder to research tech
- Add a better menu.
- Add music(i want horror boop-y stuff like a symphony of annoying boops)
